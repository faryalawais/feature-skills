name: design-contract
description: Build the enriched design contract for a feature — component anatomy, layout, spacing, states, responsive behaviour, and accessibility — from the Figma frame extract and design tokens. Use this skill whenever the user wants a design contract, design spec, component spec, UI spec, or to "spec the UI" for a feature — even if they don't say "skill". Run after spec-author (and figma-extract frame mode) and before bdd-scaffold.

# design-contract

Produces `features/<id>/contract.md` — the boundary `feature-implement` must
build within, and the fidelity reference `governance-gate` checks against.

This is the **enriched** contract. Raw design tokens give you a correct
*vocabulary* (which blue, which spacing step) but not *composition* — layout,
anatomy, states, responsive behaviour. Near-faithful UI needs that intent
written down. That is this skill's job.

## Inputs
- `features/<id>/<id>.feature` — the Gherkin spec.
- `features/<id>/figma/` — the Figma frame extract from `figma-extract` (mode B).
  **This is mandatory.** Before doing anything else, verify that ALL of the
  following exist and are non-empty for every frame listed in the feature's
  `figma_frames` in `backlog.yaml`:
  - `features/<id>/figma/spec.json`
  - `features/<id>/figma/reference.png`
  - `features/<id>/figma/notes.md`
  If any file is missing or empty → **STOP immediately**. Do not write
  `contract.md`. Do not advance status. Report exactly which files are missing
  and instruct the user to run `figma-extract` (frame mode) for the feature
  with the Figma MCP connected. There is no fallback to PRD prose or invented
  measurements.
- **Downloaded assets check (MANDATORY).** After verifying `notes.md` exists,
  read it and check for a "Downloaded assets" section. For every IMAGE, ICON,
  LOGO, BADGE, ILLUSTRATION, or VECTOR node visible in the Figma frame:
  - Each must appear in `notes.md` under "Downloaded assets" with its `public/`
    file path (e.g. `public/icons/clicon-logo.svg`).
  - Each listed file must actually exist on disk — verify with `ls public/icons/`
    and `ls public/images/`.
  - If any visible asset is missing from `notes.md`, or listed but absent on
    disk → **STOP immediately**. Do not write `contract.md`. Report which assets
    are absent and instruct the user to re-run `figma-extract` to download them.
  - If `notes.md` has an "Assets requiring manual download" section → **STOP**.
    Those assets must be provided before the contract can be written.
- `reports/tokens-report.md` — the allowed token vocabulary.

## Procedure

**Step 0 — Mandatory spec.json enumeration (do this BEFORE writing §2):**

Read `features/<id>/figma/spec.json` and build an explicit checklist of every
named element the contract must cover. Extract:

- Every `sections[].name` (top-level Figma sections)
- Every `sections[].layers[].name` (nav tiers, promo bar layers, etc.)
- Every `sections[].widgets[].name` (hero panels, side widgets, etc.)
- Every `sections[].columns[].name` (grid columns, side banners, etc.)
- Every `sections[].banners[].name` (promotional banner variations)

Write this checklist out **before** writing §2 anatomy text. Tick off each item
as you document it. A contract that skips any checklist item is incomplete —
`validate:figma-coverage` will catch it and block the gate, but catching it
BEFORE writing is far cheaper than fixing after.

**Common miss: content strings.** Some spec.json layers have a `content`
field listing interactive sub-elements separated by `·` (e.g.
`"Eng/USD dropdowns"`, `"All Category dropdown"`, `"Track Order · Compare"`).
These are Figma-defined interactive elements. Each one named in `content` must
be documented in §2 with its own entry and a `[component.*]` tag.

Fill in `contract-template.md` (in this skill's folder) for the feature:

1. **Routes** — URL paths the feature introduces or changes.
1a. **UI registry entries** — the screen and component paths the feature
   introduces. **Every named element in the §2 anatomy — interactive OR
   static — gets a `component.*` path.** Do not restrict this to buttons
   and inputs. Named sections (hero, carousel, meta row, safe-checkout
   banner, footer column) are layout contract — they must be registered so
   `bdd-scaffold` can assert their presence and `governance-gate` can
   verify they are rendered. Each entry needs a `$description`, parent
   `$screen`, and the `$states` it can be in.
   Naming follows the grammar in
   `tokens/templates/PRD-Executable-Requirements-Gherkin-Component-Paths.docx.md`
   §4.1 (`[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*` lowerCamelCase segments). `feature-implement`
   adds these entries to `tokens/ui-registry.json` before writing UI
   code; the same paths flow into Gherkin step text in backticks (per
   the PRD) and into Playwright step definitions as
   `data-testid={ids.<path>}` selectors.
1b. **API field bindings** — every API / server-sourced value shown in the UI
   gets a `field.*` path in `tokens/api-registry.json` with `$jsonPath`,
   `$source`, and `$displaysAt` component paths (see
   `tokens/templates/PRD-API-Field-Paths-and-Bindings.md`). Register slash
   aliases (e.g. `/user/info.firstName`) under `alias` when Product uses them.
   Run `npm run api-registry:build` after editing the registry.
2. **Component anatomy** — the complete element tree from the Figma frame;
   every element's role and content. **This is the implementation checklist
   for `feature-implement` — every line here will be built.** Include every
   visible element: interactive AND static. Mark leaves that render a
   registered **field** with `data-api-field={fields.…}` in addition to
   `data-testid` where applicable. Mark every leaf that is **registered**
   (per §1a) with `[component.X.Y.Z]  data-testid` so the implementor knows
   where `data-testid={ids.…}` belongs — and so the validate:contract script
   can enforce registry coverage.
   **Tag format (mandatory):** every registered element must appear in the
   anatomy as `[component.X.Y.Z]  data-testid` on its line. This is the
   machine-readable anchor that `validate:contract` parses. Missing the tag
   means the element is invisible to the gate.
   Never use placeholders like "// links here" or "(same pattern)" without
   enumerating the actual items.
   **Asset references — mandatory.** Every IMAGE, ICON, LOGO, BADGE, or
   ILLUSTRATION node in the anatomy MUST reference its exact `public/` file
   path from the "Downloaded assets" section of `notes.md` (e.g.
   `src="/icons/clicon-logo.svg"`). Never describe an asset in words (e.g.
   "orange circle logo", "Google Play icon"). The anatomy entry for an asset
   node must be: `<Image src="/icons/badge-google-play.svg" alt="..." width={N}
   height={N} />` — an implementable spec, not a prose description.
3. **Layout & spacing** — direction, gaps, padding, alignment, sizing.
   Every value expressed as an **exact** design token from
   `reports/tokens-report.md`. "Exact" means the token's resolved px value
   equals the Figma measurement to within 1px.
   **Never substitute a token whose resolved value differs from the Figma
   value** — approximations create invisible drift that compounds across
   components.

   **If any Figma measurement has no exact token — STOP before writing the
   contract.** Check `features/<id>/figma/notes.md` for a "Missing tokens"
   section and `features/<id>/figma/missing-tokens-report.md`. Then check
   `features/backlog.yaml` for this feature's entry:
   - If `allow_raw_values: true` is **not** set → **STOP**. Output:
     ```
     ⚠ MISSING TOKENS — contract blocked

     <feature id> has <N> Figma value(s) with no exact design token.
     See: features/<id>/figma/missing-tokens-report.md

     The contract cannot be written until either:
       (a) the designer adds the missing tokens and figma-extract is re-run, OR
       (b) a human explicitly sets  allow_raw_values: true  in backlog.yaml

     Claude Code will not set allow_raw_values. This is a human gate.
     ```
     Do not write `contract.md`. Do not advance status.
   - If `allow_raw_values: true` **is** set → proceed. For every measurement
     with no exact token, write the raw Figma value in the contract with a
     clear label: `gap: 136px (allow-raw — no token; approved in backlog.yaml)`
     and list it under a **"Missing tokens (allow-raw approved)"** section in
     `contract.md`. These exact values must propagate unchanged into
     `feature-implement`.

4. **Tokens** — per element: which token for background / text / border /
   radius / spacing / font size. All token names must exactly match entries
   in `reports/tokens-report.md`. If a Figma colour or radius has no exact
   token match:
   - If `allow_raw_values: true` in backlog.yaml → record the exact hex/px
     value in the "Missing tokens (allow-raw approved)" section and use the
     raw value in the contract.
   - If `allow_raw_values: true` is NOT set → **STOP** (same as step 3 above).
   Never substitute the closest token — approximations are fidelity bugs.
5. **States** — default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, empty,
   error — include only those that apply. Each state for a registered
   component should also appear in its `$states` array in §1a.
6. **Responsive** — breakpoints and what changes at each.
7. **Accessibility** — roles, labels, focus order, keyboard interaction,
   contrast expectations.
8. **Data model** — tables/columns the feature reads or writes.
9. **AC mapping** — each acceptance criterion → the scenario covering it.
10. **Visual reference** — path to `features/<id>/figma/reference.png` if present.
11. **Fidelity tolerance** — the allowed visual-diff ratio used by
    `visual-regression` (default `0.02`).

After writing all sections, execute the two mandatory checkpoints below **in
order** as Bash tool calls. Do not advance to the next step until the current
one exits 0. Do not mark `status: contracted` until both pass.

---

> ### ✦ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT A — Figma coverage
> **Run this Bash command now. Do not skip, do not defer to the user.**
> ```bash
> npm run validate:figma-coverage -- <id>
> ```
> | Exit code | Action |
> |-----------|--------|
> | **0** | Proceed to Checkpoint B |
> | **non-zero** | **STOP.** Every item in the output is a Figma element absent from §2. Add each one (with layout, tokens, content, and `[component.*]` tag) and **re-run this command** before continuing. Do not write `status: contracted`. |
>
> Refer to `features/<id>/figma/component-checklist.md` and the Step 0 checklist
> to locate missing elements. The script output names exactly what is missing.

---

> ### ✦ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT B — Contract anatomy
> **Run this Bash command now. Do not skip, do not defer to the user.**
> ```bash
> npm run validate:contract -- <id>
> ```
> Checks three invariants simultaneously:
> - Every `[component.*]` in §2 is registered in `tokens/ui-registry.json`
> - Every §1a path has ≥1 `is visible` BDD step in the `.feature` file
> - Every §2 tagged path appears in the §1a registry table
>
> | Exit code | Action |
> |-----------|--------|
> | **0** | Both checkpoints passed — advance status |
> | **non-zero** | **STOP.** Fix every reported gap (registry entries, BDD scenarios, or missing tags) and **re-run** before continuing. Do not write `status: contracted`. |

---

Only after both checkpoints exit 0: write `features/<id>/contract.md`, set the
feature's `design_contract` field in `backlog.yaml`, and advance its `status`
`specced` → `contracted`.

## Hard rules
1. **Figma extract is required.** If `features/<id>/figma/spec.json`,
   `reference.png`, or `notes.md` are missing → stop, report, do not write
   the contract. No fallback. No PRD-derived estimates.
2. **All frames, not just one.** If the backlog lists multiple `figma_frames`
   for this feature, all of them must be extracted before proceeding. A partial
   extract is treated the same as no extract.
3. **Token discipline — exact, never approximate.** Every visual measurement
   must resolve to a design token whose resolved value **exactly matches** the
   Figma measurement (within 1px / 1 hex digit). Approximations are forbidden
   even if "close". If no exact token exists, the pipeline is blocked: do NOT
   write the raw value into the contract unless `allow_raw_values: true` is set
   in backlog.yaml by a human. "Nearest token" is a fidelity bug. Automatically
   falling back to a raw value without human approval is also a bug — it hides
   design-system gaps from the designer.
4a. **Asset paths are mandatory in §2 anatomy.** Every IMAGE, ICON, LOGO, BADGE,
   or ILLUSTRATION node MUST be referenced by its actual `public/` path in the
   anatomy, not described in words. If you find yourself writing "brand logo" or
   "app store badge" without a file path → stop. Check `notes.md` "Downloaded
   assets". If the file is not there, stop and request figma-extract to re-run.
   Word-descriptions of visual assets are forbidden in `contract.md` anatomy.
5. **Full Figma capture — no simplification, no omission.** The §2 anatomy
   must document **every visible element** in the Figma frame — every column,
   row, section, icon, label, link, image placeholder, and static text block.
   Do NOT summarise or collapse. Rules:
   - If Figma shows a 4-column footer, document 4 distinct named columns with
     their exact content (title, links list, contact details, etc.).
   - If Figma shows a multi-tier nav, document every tier with every item.
   - If Figma shows static marketing copy, banners, or icon strips, document
     each one — they are part of the design, not optional decoration.
   - Never write "etc." or "…and similar items" in an anatomy element list —
     enumerate every item explicitly.
   - Non-interactive elements that are visible in Figma are required in the
     implementation. Registering them as `component.*` paths is optional;
     rendering them is NOT optional.
   A contract that omits visible Figma elements is incomplete. `feature-implement`
   will use this contract as the complete build checklist — any element absent
   from §2 is likely to be missing from the implementation too.

## Success criteria
- `contract.md` exists with all sections populated.
- Every visual value is a design token.
- §2 anatomy accounts for **every visible element** in every Figma frame —
  no sections, columns, or elements are absent or summarised with "etc."
- Every named element in §2 carries a `[component.*]  data-testid` tag.
- Every `[component.*]` tag in §2 is registered in `tokens/ui-registry.json`.
- `npm run validate:contract -- <id>` exits 0.
- Every IMAGE, ICON, LOGO, BADGE, or ILLUSTRATION in §2 anatomy references
  an actual `public/` file path — no word-only descriptions of visual assets.
- Every `public/` path referenced in the anatomy exists on disk.
- Backlog status is `contracted`.
