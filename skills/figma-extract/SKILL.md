name: figma-extract
description: Pull design data out of Figma via the Figma MCP — design tokens (Variables) and per-feature frame specs with measurements and a reference screenshot. Use this skill whenever the user wants to extract, sync, or import anything from Figma — tokens, variables, a frame, component specs, measurements, or a reference image — even if they don't say "skill". Requires the Figma Dev Mode MCP server to be connected.
---

# figma-extract

Connects the agentic SDLC loop to Figma. It has two modes; pick the one the
user is asking for.

## Prerequisite

The **Figma Dev Mode MCP server** must be connected (see the project
`GUIDE.md`). Verify a Figma MCP tool is available before doing anything. If it
is not, **stop and tell the user how to enable it** — never fabricate design
data, measurements, or screenshots.

## HARD RULE — Screenshots are visual reference only. NEVER a data source.

`get_screenshot` / `reference.png` exists to give the developer a visual
baseline. It is **never** a substitute for structured design data.

**If `get_design_context` fails or returns no structured data:**
- **STOP immediately.** Do not fall back to screenshots.
- Do not proceed to `spec.json`, `design-contract`, or any downstream skill.
- Report the exact MCP error to the user.
- Tell the user what to fix (MCP disconnected, wrong node ID, access issue,
  frame too large — follow the Large Frame Protocol below instead).

A screenshot-only extraction produces zero measurements, zero token mappings,
and zero component anatomy. Any implementation built from it will deviate from
the Figma design. **This is forbidden.**

The only exception: after structured data is successfully extracted, screenshots
are taken as visual reference (step 2 / step 1d). They accompany `spec.json`,
not replace it.

---

## Mode A — `tokens`  (refresh the design system)

Use when the user wants to (re)build the design tokens from Figma.

The token set lives in **three sibling files** under `tokens/`, matching the
Tokens Studio for Figma plugin export convention (see
`tokens/templates/` for the reference shape):

1. **`tokens/primitives.json`** — raw scale tokens. Every leaf carries
   `$extensions.layer = "primitive"`.
2. **`tokens/semantics.json`** — intent-named DTCG aliases pointing into
   primitives. App code, BDD steps, and design contracts reference *these*,
   not primitives. Every leaf carries `$extensions.layer = "semantic"` and
   `$extensions.aliasOf = "<primitive.path>"`. Every alias `$value` is a
   `{group.token}` reference into a primitive.
3. **`tokens/typography.json`** — compound `$type: typography` tokens. Each
   `$value` composes aliases into `font.family / weight / size / lineHeight`
   from `primitives.json`. Layer marker is `"semantic"`.

### Required value forms (W3C DTCG, latest draft)

Use the **object** value forms, not the older string forms. They round-trip
cleanly to Figma Variables and survive future DTCG spec moves.

- **color**: `{ "colorSpace": "srgb", "components": [r, g, b], "alpha": 1 }`
  with r/g/b normalised to `0..1`. Not `"#rrggbb"` strings.
- **dimension** (spacing, radius, font size, line height): `{ "value": 16,
  "unit": "px" }`. Not `"16px"` strings. (Tokens Studio uses `"number"`
  type for unitless spacing — we use `"dimension"` with `"px"` instead, more
  DTCG-correct.)
- **shadow**: `{ "color": "rgba(...)", "offsetX": {value, unit},
  "offsetY": {value, unit}, "blur": {value, unit}, "spread": {value, unit} }`
- **fontFamily**: array of strings (e.g. `["Inter", "system-ui",
  "sans-serif"]`).
- **typography** (compound): `$value` object with
  `fontFamily / fontSize / fontWeight / lineHeight` (and optionally
  `letterSpacing`). **Sub-properties SHOULD be aliases** (e.g.
  `"fontSize": "{font.size.xl}"`) — Tokens Studio's export inlines literals
  because of plugin limits; we prefer aliases for single-source-of-truth.

### Required token groups

**`primitives.json`** must contain:
- `color.{primary, secondary, tertiary, error, success, warning, info,
  typography, outline, background, indicator}` — colour ramps. `background`
  also carries the literal swatches (`error/warning/success/info/muted/
  light/dark`); `typography` carries `white/gray/black`.
- `colorDark.*` — dark-mode mirror of the colour ramps. (CSS-only; see
  W-1 in the report.)
- `spacing` — numeric scale, keys preserve the consumer convention
  (e.g. Tailwind `"0", "px", "0.5", "1", …, "96"`).
- `radii.{none, sm, base, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl, full}`.
- `font.family` / `font.weight` / `font.size` / `font.lineHeight`.
- `shadows.{hard-1..5, soft-1..4}`.

**`semantics.json`** must contain (extend as the system grows; never shrink):
- `color.surface.{canvas, raised, sunken, muted, inverse, inverse-muted}` —
  flat (surfaces don't carry interaction states).
- `color.text.{primary, secondary, tertiary, disabled, inverse,
  inverse-muted, link, accent, success, warning, error, info}` — flat.
- `color.border.{default, subtle, strong, focus, success, warning, error,
  info}` — flat.
- `color.action.{primary | secondary | tertiary | danger}` **nested by
  state then slot**:
  - state ∈ `{default, hover, active, focused, disabled}`
  - slot ∈ `{background, label}` (plus `border` on `focused`)
- `color.input` — flat slots (`surface, border, placeholder-dim`,
  `icon.{default, error, disabled}`) plus
  `color.input.default.{empty | focused | filled | error | disabled}` with
  per-state slots (`border, placeholder, value, helper, surface`).
- `color.feedback.{success | warning | error | info}.{background,
  foreground, border, icon}`.
- `color.focus.{ring, ring-error, ring-info}`.
- `space.{xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl, gap, gutter, section}`.
- `radius.{control, surface, panel, pill, sharp}`.
- `shadow.{sm, md, lg, focus}`.

**`typography.json`** must contain compound tokens for at least
`typography.{display | heading | body | label}.{size}.{weight}`. See
`reports/tokens-report.md` and `tokens/typography.json` for the current
catalogue.

### Steps

1. Ask which Figma file to read (or use the one the user supplied).
2. **Read primitives.** Use the Figma MCP's variable/styles capability
   (`get_variable_defs` or equivalent) to read every Variable and style.
   Map them to DTCG **object** value forms above, and emit them into
   `tokens/primitives.json`. If the Figma file is a published code-first
   system (e.g. gluestack-ui), prefer that system's canonical config over
   the partial Figma export and note the source in
   `$extensions.source` (cite the upstream commit).
3. **Read semantics from Figma if present.** If the Figma file has a
   *Semantic* (or *Alias*) Variable collection that points at the
   primitives, convert those to DTCG aliases with `{group.token}`
   references and emit them into `tokens/semantics.json`. Otherwise, skip
   to step 4.
4. **Synthesize any missing semantic groups.** For every required group
   listed above, if no semantic alias was extracted in step 3, add one
   keyed to the nearest primitive. Use **state.slot nesting** for
   `action.*` and `input.*` — do not flatten them. Pick alias targets
   deliberately and record the choice in `$extensions.aliasOf`; do not
   invent values.
5. **Build/preserve typography compounds.** If the Figma file has
   typography styles, convert them to `$type: typography` tokens with
   aliased sub-properties, and emit them into `tokens/typography.json`.
   Otherwise, leave the existing `tokens/typography.json` untouched.
6. **Write/overwrite the three files** with the matching layer markers.
   Every semantic leaf MUST have a `{group.token}` `$value` that resolves
   to an existing primitive — the **design-tokens** skill will fail the
   build if not.
7. **Tell the user to run the `design-tokens` skill next** to validate +
   compile.

**Honesty notes:**
- Figma Variable export via MCP can be incomplete (missing modes, partial
  collections). If the result is not clean DTCG, say so plainly and
  recommend the **Tokens Studio for Figma** plugin export as the more
  reliable path. Never silently emit malformed tokens.
- If the only source is a code-first system (e.g. gluestack-ui), say so
  and use the canonical TypeScript/JSON config from that system, not a
  scraped Figma cover file. Cite the upstream commit in `$extensions.source`.
- The semantic and typography files are the team's authored contract.
  **Never delete existing semantic groups or typography compounds** when
  refreshing primitives — instead, fail loudly if a refresh would orphan
  an alias (target primitive removed), and ask the user before changing
  the mapping.
- **Do not put a top-level `$description` in any of the three files.**
  Style Dictionary merges all sources into one document and reports
  collisions on duplicate top-level keys. Per-file documentation belongs
  in `reports/tokens-report.md`.

---

## Mode B — `frame`  (capture one feature's design intent)

Use per feature, after `spec-author`, to give `design-contract` real data.

Inputs: a feature `id`, and the Figma frame/node URL for that feature.

Outputs, under `features/<id>/figma/`:
- `spec.json` — structured design data: the element tree; layout per container
  (direction, gap, padding, alignment); per-element measurements; the component
  states present in the design.
- `component-checklist.md` — **mandatory human-readable list** of every named
  element in `spec.json` that `design-contract` must document in §2 anatomy.
  Format (append a row for each named entity, hierarchically indented):
  ```
  # Figma Component Checklist — <feature-id>
  Generated from spec.json. design-contract MUST cover every row below in §2.

  ## Navigation
  - [ ] Promo Bar
  - [ ] Top Nav  (content: Welcome text · Follow Us social icons · Eng/USD dropdowns)
  - [ ] Middle Nav  (content: Logo · Search bar · Cart/Wishlist/User icons)
  - [ ] Bottom Nav  (content: All Category dropdown · Track Order · Compare · ...)

  ## Hero Widgets
  - [ ] Main Hero — Xbox Consoles
  - [ ] Small Widget 1 — Google Pixel 6 Pro
  ...
  ```
  This file is the downstream "do not miss" contract for `design-contract`.
  `validate:figma-coverage` uses `spec.json` (not this file) for machine
  enforcement, but this checklist is the human-readable companion.
- `reference.png` — a screenshot export of the frame (the visual baseline).
- `notes.md` — anything the structured data cannot capture.
- (per asset) downloaded SVG/PNG files saved to `public/icons/` or `public/images/`
  and listed in `notes.md` under "Downloaded assets".

## HARD RULE — No prose-collapsed sections (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This is the single most common cause of Figma components being silently missed
in contract and implementation. **It is forbidden in all circumstances.**

**Prose-collapsing** means writing a section's visual sub-elements as a single
summary string in the `content` field instead of as named objects in structured
arrays. Example:

```json
// ✗ FORBIDDEN — prose-collapsed. Sub-elements are invisible to all downstream
// tools (design-contract, validate:figma-coverage, governance-gate).
{ "name": "Newsletter", "content": "Email form with brand logos" }

// ✓ REQUIRED — structured. Every sub-element is named and discoverable.
{
  "name": "Newsletter",
  "layers": [
    { "name": "Copy Block",  "content": "Heading text · body text" },
    { "name": "Form Card",   "content": "Email input · Subscribe button + arrow icon" },
    { "name": "Divider",     "content": "Horizontal rule 424px" },
    { "name": "Brand Logos", "content": "Google · Amazon · Philips · Toshiba · Samsung (72×72, opacity-60)" }
  ]
}
```

**The rule:**
- `content` as a **string** is allowed ONLY on leaf-level entries that represent
  a single TEXT node (e.g., a label, a heading, a caption). It must be the
  literal text string the node renders, or a `·`-separated list of the text
  strings inside a simple text group.
- `content` as a **string** is FORBIDDEN on any section or sub-element that
  contains multiple visual child frames, groups, or components. Those children
  MUST be enumerated as named objects in `layers`, `widgets`, `columns`, or
  `banners`.
- After writing spec.json, run `validate:figma-coverage` — its Check 2 scans
  for prose-collapsed sections and exits non-zero if any are found. A non-zero
  exit means the extraction is incomplete and must be re-done.

**How to know which array to use:**
| Child type in Figma | Array to use in spec.json |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Horizontal nav tiers, stacked content rows | `layers` |
| Side-by-side widgets (hero panels, banners) | `widgets` |
| Vertical grid/table columns | `columns` |
| Promotional banners | `banners` |
| Everything else | `layers` (default) |

---

Steps:
1. Use the Figma MCP context/metadata capability (`get_design_context`,
   `get_metadata`) to read the frame's structure and measurements. Walk the
   **entire node tree recursively** — every GROUP, FRAME, COMPONENT, INSTANCE,
   VECTOR, TEXT, RECTANGLE, and ELLIPSE. Do not skip hidden layers that are
   visible in the design (check `visible !== false`).
   For every section node, walk **one level deeper** to enumerate its named
   child frames/groups. Each named child becomes a named object in the
   appropriate structured array. Never collapse children into a prose string.

   ### ⚠ LARGE FRAME PROTOCOL — mandatory when the full frame exceeds MCP limits

   Full-page Figma frames (product detail, homepage, checkout) routinely exceed
   the `get_design_context` token budget and return an error or a saved file
   that is too large to read in one pass. **Do not retry on the full frame.**
   Doing so will always fail or truncate — you will get an incomplete tree and
   will miss sections, which leads to spec.json prose-collapse or omissions.

   When the full frame fails, use this four-step section-by-section approach:

   **Step 1a — Get section node IDs (never omit this step)**
   Call `get_metadata` on the full frame node ID. This returns the frame's
   top-level children with their `id` and `name` without the deep subtree.
   Extract the node ID and name of every top-level child (Nav, Breadcrumb,
   ProductContent, Tabs, RelatedProducts, Footer, etc.).

   **Step 1b — Call `get_design_context` per section**
   For each top-level section node ID from step 1a, call `get_design_context`
   with that section's node ID (not the parent frame). Each section fits within
   the budget. Read the complete output for each section before moving to the
   next. Do not batch-read multiple sections — read one, extract all named
   children, then proceed to the next.

   **Step 1c — Build the section inventory**
   From each section's `get_design_context` response, extract:
   - Every named `data-name` element and its `data-node-id`
   - Layout classNames (flex direction, gap, padding, alignment)
   - Typography classNames (font size, weight, line-height)
   - Colour variables (`var(--token-name, #fallback)` — extract the token name)
   - Dimensions from `width` / `height` inline styles
   Record these as named structured objects in `spec.json` — never as prose.

   **nodeId is MANDATORY on every named object in spec.json.**
   Every entry in `sections[]`, `layers[]`, `widgets[]`, `columns[]`, and
   `banners[]` MUST include a `"nodeId"` field taken from the `data-node-id`
   attribute on the corresponding element in the `get_design_context` response.
   This is the key that flows downstream: spec.json → contract.md §2 → fe-implement
   per-component extraction. Without it, `design-contract` cannot write nodeIds
   into §2, and `fe-implement` cannot call `get_design_context` per component.

   Required shape for every named spec.json entry:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "ProductCard",
     "nodeId": "394:7726",
     "width": 234,
     "height": 320,
     "layout": "flex column",
     "gap": "8px",
     "padding": "15px",
     "layers": [ ... ]
   }
   ```
   An entry without `"nodeId"` is incomplete. Do not write spec.json until
   every named element has its nodeId recorded.

   **Step 1d — Screenshot each section separately**
   Call `get_screenshot` with `contentsOnly: true` on each section node for
   a cropped visual reference. Do NOT screenshot the full frame — the image
   will be too small to read or will time out. Save one PNG per section:
   `features/<id>/figma/reference-<section-name>.png`.

   After completing steps 1a–1d for all sections, proceed to step 2 with the
   complete multi-section spec data. The output spec.json must cover every
   section; a section present in step 1a but absent from spec.json is a
   hard error — return to step 1b for that section before writing any outputs.
2. Use the Figma MCP screenshot capability (`get_screenshot`) to export
   `reference.png` at the frame's native resolution (2× if possible).
3. **Token mapping — exact, not approximate (NON-NEGOTIABLE).**
   For **every** measurement in the frame, map it to the **exact** matching
   semantic token from `reports/tokens-report.md`:
   - A match is exact when the token's resolved px value equals the Figma
     measurement to within 1px (floating-point rounding only).
   - **"Nearest token" is forbidden.** Never write a token whose resolved
     value differs from the Figma measurement. If `space.md = 16px` and
     Figma shows 20px, `space.md` is NOT a valid mapping — it is an
     approximation and will cause visual drift.
   - For colours: the exact Figma colour hex must match the token's resolved
     hex exactly. No "visually close" substitutions.
   - Record in `notes.md` under "Token mapping" a table:
     `| Node path | Property | Figma value | Token used | Resolved value | Exact? |`
     Every row must have Exact? = YES.
   - **If ANY measurement has no exact matching token — STOP immediately.**
     Do not proceed to write outputs or advance to `design-contract`.
     Instead, produce a **Missing Tokens Action Report** in
     `features/<id>/figma/missing-tokens-report.md` using this format:

     ```
     # Missing Tokens — <feature id>
     Generated: <date>
     
     The following Figma measurements have no exact matching design token.
     The design system must be extended before this feature can be contracted.
     
     ## Action required (designer)
     
     For each row below, add the listed token to `tokens/semantics.json`
     (or `tokens/primitives.json` for a new scale step), then run:
         npm run tokens:validate
         npm run tokens:validate-figma-alignment
         npm run tokens:build
     Once all rows are resolved, re-run figma-extract for this feature.
     
     | # | Node path | Property | Figma value | Closest existing token | Closest resolved value | Recommended new token |
     |---|-----------|----------|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
     | 1 | Footer/Col1 | gap | 20px | space.md | 16px | space.lg-alt = 20px |
     ...
     
     ## How to allow raw values (last resort)
     
     If the designer confirms these values are intentional one-offs and should
     NOT be added to the token system, a human may unblock the pipeline by
     setting in `features/backlog.yaml` for this feature:
         allow_raw_values: true
     
     This flag is a deliberate human override. It allows `design-contract`
     and `feature-implement` to proceed with `allow-raw` annotations for
     these exact values. The governance gate will verify every `allow-raw`
     comment matches this report.
     ```

     Then output to the user:
     ```
     ⚠ MISSING TOKENS — pipeline blocked

     <N> Figma measurement(s) in frame "<frame name>" have no exact design token:
       • <Node path>: <property> = <value> (closest: <token> = <resolved>)
       ...

     The design system is incomplete for this feature.

     Designer action: open features/<id>/figma/missing-tokens-report.md
     and add the listed tokens to tokens/semantics.json, then re-run:
       npm run tokens:build
       /figma-extract (frame mode, this feature)

     To skip token addition and allow raw values instead (last resort):
       Set  allow_raw_values: true  in the feature's backlog.yaml entry.
       A human must set this flag — Claude Code will not set it automatically.
     ```
     **Do not write `spec.json`, `reference.png`, or `notes.md` until all
     tokens are resolved OR `allow_raw_values: true` is set in backlog.yaml.**
     If `allow_raw_values: true` is already set, proceed — record all
     unmapped measurements in `notes.md` under "Missing tokens (allow-raw
     approved)" with their exact Figma values, then continue to step 4.
4. **Download ALL visual assets — exhaustive scan (NON-NEGOTIABLE).**
   Scan the entire node tree from step 1. For every node of type IMAGE, VECTOR,
   COMPONENT, INSTANCE, or RECTANGLE-with-image-fill that represents a visual
   asset rendered in the final UI:
   - **Icons and SVG assets** (VECTOR, icon components, decorative graphics):
     Export as SVG via Figma REST API:
     `GET /v1/images/{file_key}?ids={node_id}&format=svg&svg_include_id=true`
     Save to `public/icons/<descriptive-name>.svg`.
   - **Photos and raster images** (RECTANGLE with image fill, product photos,
     hero images, banners):
     Export as PNG at 2× scale:
     `GET /v1/images/{file_key}?ids={node_id}&format=png&scale=2`
     Save to `public/images/<descriptive-name>.png` or `.jpg`.
   - **Brand marks, logos, badges** (App Store, Google Play, payment icons,
     social media icons, brand logos):
     Export as SVG. If rasterised, export as PNG at 2×.
     Save to `public/icons/` with a prefix matching the brand:
     `badge-google-play.svg`, `icon-visa.svg`, `logo-clicon.svg`.
   - **Naming convention:** kebab-case, descriptive, unique.
     `icon-truck.svg`, `icon-return-arrow.svg`, `badge-google-play.svg`,
     `hero-xbox-controller.png`. Never `node_123456.png`.
   - **Never substitute.** The following are all forbidden regardless of
     difficulty:
     - Unicode emoji or symbol characters (`🍎`, `★`, `✕`, `▶`, `→`)
     - Text labels in place of image files (`<span>Google Play</span>`)
     - Hand-coded SVG paths approximating a brand icon (the real SVG from
       Figma is always authoritative)
     - Colored `<div>` CSS shapes in place of a logo
     - Next.js `<Image>` pointing to a placeholder or missing file
   - **STOP** if any export call fails. Report the node ID, node name, and
     HTTP error. Do not use a substitute. Wait for the user to resolve the
     issue (e.g. access a shared library, grant API token scope).
   - Record every asset in `notes.md` under "Downloaded assets":
     ```
     | Node ID | Node name | Type | File saved | Dimensions |
     ```
   - If a node cannot be exported for a legitimate technical reason (master
     in inaccessible shared library, protected file), record it under
     "Assets requiring manual download" with instructions for the user.
     **STOP immediately** if this section is non-empty — do not proceed to
     `design-contract`.
5. **Verify completeness before writing outputs.**
   After downloading, re-read the node tree and the "Downloaded assets" table
   side by side. Every visual asset node must have an entry. If any visual
   asset node has no corresponding entry → the scan was incomplete → repeat
   step 4 for the missing nodes.
   Run `ls public/icons/ public/images/` and confirm every listed path exists.
   Any listed path that does not exist on disk → re-download before continuing.

5a. **Write `features/<id>/figma/asset-manifest.json` (MANDATORY).**
    After completing step 5, write a machine-readable manifest of every visual
    asset found in the frame. This file is the bridge between Figma extraction
    and the filesystem verification that runs at the governance gate.

    Format:
    ```json
    {
      "$meta": {
        "feature": "<id>",
        "frame": "<node-id>",
        "generatedAt": "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
      },
      "assets": [
        {
          "nodeId":     "<figma-node-id>",
          "nodeName":   "<human-readable name from Figma>",
          "figmaUrl":   "<http://localhost:3845/assets/... or REST API URL>",
          "localPath":  "public/icons/<name>.svg",
          "type":       "svg | png | jpg",
          "dataSource": "static | dynamic"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    `dataSource` rules:
    - `"static"` — the exact Figma asset is always rendered (logos, icons,
      badges, payment marks, app-store badges, decorative illustrations).
      `validate:assets` will verify these files exist on disk.
    - `"dynamic"` — the asset comes from a database / API at runtime (product
      photos, user avatars, category images). The Figma value is an example
      only. `validate:assets` skips these — they are listed so the contract
      knows what content type to expect at each location.

    **After writing the manifest, run the mandatory checkpoint:**

    > ### ✦ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT — Asset files on disk
    > **Run this Bash command now as a tool call. Do not hand off to
    > design-contract until it exits 0.**
    > ```bash
    > npm run validate:assets -- <id>
    > ```
    > Reads `asset-manifest.json` and verifies every static asset exists on
    > disk and is non-empty.
    >
    > | Exit code | Action |
    > |-----------|--------|
    > | **0** | All static assets confirmed — proceed to step 6 |
    > | **1 (missing/empty files)** | **STOP.** Re-download the flagged assets using the `figmaUrl` from the manifest, then re-run. Do not proceed to step 6. |
    > | **2 (no manifest)** | The manifest was not written — write it now, then re-run. |

6. **Populate `tokens/ui-registry.json`** with any new screens or components
   the frame introduces. See "UI registry — sibling contract" below for the
   shape and rules. The component states observed in step 1 become each
   entry's `$states` array. Re-run `npm run ui-registry:build` so the
   test-id constants in `tokens/build/test-ids.ts` and the glossary in
   `reports/ui-registry-glossary.md` are refreshed before the next skill
   consumes them. These paths flow downstream:
   - `design-contract` lists them in its §1a "UI registry entries"
     section (the contract's testable surface).
   - `feature-implement` renders `data-testid={ids.<path>}` on the
     corresponding element using the typed accessor.
   - `bdd-scaffold` selects elements by `getByTestId(ids.<path>)` in
     step definitions.
   - `governance-gate` runs `ui-registry:check-sync` to require that
     every path you register here is actually rendered by the end of
     implementation.
7. **Generate `component-checklist.md` (MANDATORY — do as a file write, not
   a note to self).** After walking the full node tree, write
   `features/<id>/figma/component-checklist.md` enumerating every named
   section and sub-element. Format:
   ```markdown
   # Figma Component Checklist — <feature-id>
   Auto-generated by figma-extract. design-contract MUST document every row
   below in §2 anatomy. validate:figma-coverage enforces this mechanically.

   ## <Section Name>  (nodeId: 391:6653)
   - [ ] <Layer/Widget/Column/Banner name>  (nodeId: 394:7726)  (content: "<content string verbatim>")
   ...
   ```
   Include every entry from `spec.json`'s `sections[].name`,
   `sections[].layers[].name`, `sections[].widgets[].name`,
   `sections[].columns[].name`, `sections[].banners[].name`.
   **Every checklist row MUST include `(nodeId: X:Y)` — this is what
   `design-contract` copies into §2 anatomy and what `fe-implement` uses to
   call `get_design_context` per component. A checklist row without a nodeId
   is incomplete and will cause drift during implementation.**
   For layers/widgets with a `content` field, quote it verbatim — this makes
   interactive sub-elements (dropdowns, buttons listed in content strings)
   explicit and uncollapsible for `design-contract`.

   After writing the file, print its full contents to the user output so the
   list is visible and cannot be silently skipped downstream. End with:

   > ⚠ design-contract MUST cover every unchecked item above.
   > `npm run validate:figma-coverage -- <id>` will enforce this mechanically.

8. Write the remaining output files under `features/<id>/figma/`
   (`spec.json`, `reference.png`, `notes.md`).

9. **Self-validate spec.json before handing off — run now as a Bash tool call:**

   > ### ✦ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT — Prose-collapse detection
   > **Run this Bash command now. Do not hand off to design-contract until it exits 0.**
   > ```bash
   > npm run validate:figma-coverage -- <id>
   > ```
   > Check 2 of this script scans spec.json for prose-collapsed sections — sections
   > where visual sub-elements were collapsed into a `content` string instead of
   > being written as named objects in `layers`/`widgets`/`columns`/`banners`.
   >
   > | Exit code | Action |
   > |-----------|--------|
   > | **0** | spec.json is structurally sound — hand off to design-contract |
   > | **non-zero** | **STOP.** Every flagged section in the output must be re-walked in Figma. Enumerate each named child frame/group as a structured entry in the correct array. Then re-write spec.json, regenerate component-checklist.md (step 7), and re-run this command. Do not proceed to design-contract with prose-collapsed sections. |

   Note: contract.md does not exist yet at this stage, so Check 1 (named-entity
   coverage) will not run — only Check 2 (prose-collapse) fires here. That is
   the correct and expected behaviour.

## Mode C — `all-frames`  (bulk extraction of every frame in a file)

Use when the user wants to extract all frames from a Figma file at once, audit
what was missed, or ensure complete coverage before a full re-implementation.

Inputs: a Figma file key (e.g. `XZYoUnFtfWZJQJIJUIvqHs`).

Outputs:
- One set of `spec.json` + `reference.png` + `notes.md` per top-level frame,
  written to `features/<frame-slug>/figma/`.
- A `reports/figma-all-frames.md` coverage report listing every frame, its
  node ID, and extraction status (complete / partial / failed).

Steps:
1. Use `get_metadata` or equivalent to list every top-level FRAME in the file.
   Record the frame name, node ID, and approximate dimensions.
2. For each frame (process sequentially — one at a time to avoid MCP timeouts):
   a. Run Mode B steps 1–7 for that frame, writing outputs to
      `features/<slug>/figma/` where `<slug>` is the kebab-case frame name
      (e.g. `01-homepage`, `07-shop-page`, `15-checkout-form`).
   b. On any failure (MCP timeout, export error, missing asset), record the
      error in `reports/figma-all-frames.md` and continue to the next frame.
      Do not stop the entire run for a single frame failure.
3. Write `reports/figma-all-frames.md`:
   ```
   | Frame | Node ID | Status | Assets downloaded | Missing tokens | Notes |
   ```
4. Report summary to the user: total frames, successfully extracted, partially
   extracted (missing assets), failed.

**Hard limit:** Never process more than one frame per MCP call. If a frame's
node tree is very large (> 500 nodes), split it into sections and extract each
section separately, merging results into a single `spec.json`.

**Asset extraction honesty rules:**
- If the Figma file uses a node type of `RECTANGLE` with an image fill
  (a rasterised photo), export it as PNG at 2× scale.
- If a node is a component instance whose master is in a shared library
  file you cannot access, note it and ask the user for the SVG/PNG export.
- `notes.md` must list every visual element in the frame and explicitly say
  either "downloaded → public/..." or "not exportable — reason".
- `design-contract` (downstream) MUST reference the actual file paths, not
  describe icons in words. If no asset path is listed in `notes.md`, the
  contract cannot be written and `design-contract` must stop and report.

## UI registry — sibling contract

Beside the DTCG token files (`tokens/primitives.json`, `tokens/semantics.json`,
`tokens/typography.json`) lives **`tokens/ui-registry.json`** — the
versioned source of truth for **screen** and **component** paths used in
Gherkin scenarios. It is specified by
`tokens/templates/PRD-Executable-Requirements-Gherkin-Component-Paths.docx.md`.

**Why a sibling, not a token group:** a design token resolves to a *value*
(a colour, a number) and is processed by Style Dictionary. A component path
resolves to an *identity* (a thing with structure and states) — it is not a
value. Same path-as-contract discipline, different storage.

### Shape (PRD §4.2)

```json
{
  "$metadata": { "version": "x.y.z", "description": "...", "owner": "..." },
  "screen": {
    "<feature>": {
      "<screenKey>": { "$description": "..." }
    }
  },
  "component": {
    "<feature>": {
      "<screenKey>": {
        "<componentKey>": {
          "$description": "...",
          "$screen": "screen.<feature>.<screenKey>",
          "$states": ["default", "disabled", "loading"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Grammar (PRD §4.1, enforced by `npm run ui-registry:validate`)

```
<path>    ::= <domain> "." <segment> ( "." <segment> )+
<domain>  ::= "screen" | "component"
<segment> ::= [a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*                 # lowerCamelCase, no underscores/dashes
```

Other validator rules: every leaf needs a `$description`; every component
`$screen` must resolve to a registered screen path; `$states` must be a
non-empty array of distinct lowerCamelCase strings.

### Build artifacts

`npm run ui-registry:build` emits:
- `tokens/build/test-ids.ts` — `testIds` (flat path→id map) and `ids` (nested
  tree). Component code imports these and renders them on the real element
  (`data-testid={ids.component.checkout.cart.checkoutButton}`).
- `reports/ui-registry-glossary.md` — human-readable table of every screen
  and component with description, parent screen, states, and generated
  test-id.

### Authoring contract

- **Never delete a registered path** without checking call sites. The path
  is a contract — Gherkin scenarios, tests, and component code reference it.
  Deprecate via `$deprecated: true` (future) before removal.
- **Do not write test-ids by hand.** They are derived from the path
  (dots → dashes). Always import from `tokens/build/test-ids.ts`.
- **When a feature is approved**, the example seeds (`[EXAMPLE] …` paths
  under `screen.checkout.*` and `component.checkout.*`) should be deleted
  once the registry has real entries — they exist only to keep the pipeline
  emitting non-trivial output during the PoC.

## Success criteria
- Mode A: `tokens/design-tokens.json` exists and is valid JSON in DTCG shape.
- Mode B: all three files under `features/<id>/figma/` exist, and
  `reference.png` is a real export (not a placeholder).

## Failure handling
If the Figma MCP is unavailable, or the file/frame URL is wrong, **stop and
report**. Do not invent measurements, tokens, or images.
